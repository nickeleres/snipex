		<h3>SnippetExchange is a forum for project owners to connect with contractors on micro-exchanges</h3>

		<ul>
			<li class='about_line'>Use Snipex when you can't figure out how to float your navbar around a block element</li>
			<li class='about_line'>Use Snipex when you are looking to turn a graphic into a piece of code to plug into your app</li>
			<li class='about_line'>Use Snipex when you need help coding responsive/cross-browser-compatible CSS styles</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Here's how it works...</h2>
		<p class='how_it_works'>Once a developer or designer sees a post on Snipex that they can solve, they add a message to that post either accepting the price and timeline, proposing what they would do it for, or requesting more information.</p>

		<p class='how_it_works'>Once the poster finds a match, they will select that message, and both the poster and the contractor will be emailed notifying them.  The notification message includes the email addresses of both parties, and communication continues off of snipexchange.com</p>
